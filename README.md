# Password Generator
This project uses javascript in conjunction with an interactive web application created with HTML and CSS. The user is prompted with options to create a password under different parameters such as which types of characters to be included in the password and the length of the password created. Javascript logic is used to determine whether or not the user wants to create a password when prompted, determines the parameters for the password to be created, fills an array with posssible characters to be used in the final password, then randomizes characters to create a password of the length that the user defined which is displayed to the page.
